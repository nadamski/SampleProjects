Triforce Blitz.ipynb is my primary file, which scrapes ~300 json files from the website, then compiles them into a list of structured objects. Then I play around with some sample visualizations.

Shiny test.ipynb selects my favorite visualizations, and compiles them into a Python-Shiny dashboard, with some basic interactivity. This file writes the app.py file, then runs it.

app.py is the created python app, and Triforce_data.pkl is a python pickle for storing the data.
