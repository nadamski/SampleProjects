## My Projects
Welcome to my github sample projects. 

## PhD 
My PhD work was on the computational analysis of semiconductor materials for solar cell applications.

I worked on Zinc-Germanium-Nitride and Zinc-Tin-Nitride, evaluating electrical conductivity for a variety of potential dopant elements. 
Identifying Phosphorus sitting on a Germanium site as the most promising candidate.

## Machine Learning

I've applied machine learning principles to analyze data and make predictions

## Video Game Dashboards

Sometimes I analyze randomized video games. In this case, I looked at the Triforce Blitz variant of the Legend of Zelda Randomizer. 

The dashboard was built with Python shiny. While this image is not interactive, the code can be downloaded above.
