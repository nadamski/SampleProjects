## My Projects
Welcome to my github sample projects. 

## PhD 
My PhD work was on the computational analysis of semiconductor materials for solar cell applications. 

I worked on Zinc-Germanium-Nitride and Zinc-Tin-Nitride, evaluating electrical conductivity for a variety of potential dopant elements.
